## FAQ

#### Where is Tetris

To the left of the themes button

#### Are there any shortcuts?

Yes! Pressing Ctrl+T opens a new tab, Ctrl+W closes the browser, Ctrl+R refreshes the page and pressing the back space key on tetris closes the window

### Does the password system remember you?

Yes it does! If you enter the previous master password that you used it will have saved all of those passwords to that master password. If you enter the wrong one it will launch the browser on a new profile

## Optimizations

I am trying to improve the perforamnce of the browser as loading game sis slow and youtube can be stuttery at higher resolutuions and in full screen
